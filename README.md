# Deploying TorchServe Models with External Libraries in Offline Environments
This project demonstrates the complete process of building and deploying offline a machine learning model to predict passenger survivability on the Titanic using PyTorch and TorchServe. It includes the development environment code for training the model and the necessary files for deploying the model in a production environment without internet access.
